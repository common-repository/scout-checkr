# Version 0.1.70


## Overview

## Changes

Bug fixing :

- The content for the grafana dashboard is created by cron. if the cron is not executed, then the dashboard will not be created

- grafana address with a slash is not processed

- when implemented through infinity, the data was formed through rest api (json). datea source always contained up-to-date data, it gets them from the link to the site

in the current version - the content is static and is created only once. there is no synchronization in the code. you need to add a content update in grafana by cron
